============================================================================================================! The SQL Execution Order !=======================================================================================================================================

Step,      Clause,                  Purpose
1st,      FROM / JOIN            Determines the data source (the tables) and combines them (if necessary) to form the base result set. This is always the starting point.
2nd,      WHERE                  Filters the rows from the base result set before any grouping or aggregation.
3rd,      GROUP BY               Partitions the filtered rows into groups for aggregation.
4th,      HAVING                 Filters the groups created by GROUP BY (based on aggregate results).
5th,      SELECT                 Calculates aggregate functions and selects the final columns.
6th,      ORDER BY               Sorts the final result set.
7th,      LIMIT / OFFSET         Limits the number of rows returned.

=> Execution vs. Writing: The order above is the execution order. We write the query in a different order (e.g., SELECT first, FROM second).
=> The Precise GROUP BY Rule:
  -> If your SELECT list contains ONLY aggregate functions OR ONLY non-aggregate functions, you DO NOT need a GROUP BY clause.
  -> If your SELECT list contains a mix of both aggregate functions and non-aggregate functions, you MUST include a GROUP BY clause. The non-aggregated columns define how the data should be partitioned for the calculation.
